# Workshop: Advanced Topics in R

This repository contains materials for the workshop **Advanced Topics in R**, offered by the Research Training Group "Statistical Modeling in Psychology" (SMiP). 

Instructors: Martin Schnuerch & David Izydorczyk

The workshop consists of three parts:

- Introduction to Benchmarking &  Profiling
- Introduction to Vectorization & the Power of C++ with Rcpp
- Introduction to Parallelization


The following code can be used to install the packages used in this workshop:

```r
wanted.packages <- c("plyr", "tidyverse", "devtools", "tictoc", "benchmarkme", "bench", "data.table", 
"profvis", "foreach", "doSNOW", "Rcpp", "doParallel")
  
# Check what packages need to be installed
new.packages <- wanted.packages[!(wanted.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
  
 # install the not yet installed but required packages and load them
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages,dependencies = TRUE)
sapply(wanted.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

You should also install Rtools (Windows), see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) or [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/installr/versions/0.22.0/topics/install.Rtools), or Xcode (Mac), see [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-on-os-x/) (scroll down) for instructions.
